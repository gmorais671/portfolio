    detailedDescription: '''
      As a freelance developer, I created a custom Flutter application for VM Tabacos, a wholesale distributor of tobacco-related products. The app was designed to streamline their business operations â€” allowing the client to manage inventory, track purchases and sales, control cash flow, and generate detailed reports through a user-friendly mobile interface.
      Built in Flutter and integrated with Firebase Functions (backend by a partner), the solution remained in active use for over two years, helping the client maintain operational control and make informed decisions based on real-time data. It was a full-cycle delivery experience, from design to deployment, that brought lasting value to a small business.

        '''Developed a fuzzy logic controller in C for automated water tank level management. Designed the interface and implemented the system on a real lab-scale plant at UNIFEI.''',
    detailedDescription: '''
      For my Bachelor's thesis at UNIFEI, I developed an automation system to control the water level in a tank using fuzzy logic. The project involved designing a decision-making controller in C, implementing it on embedded hardware, and building a custom interface to monitor and adjust system behavior.
      The controller was deployed on a real lab-scale plant and performed with greater precision and stability than expected. This project allowed me to apply advanced control theory in a hands-on environment, combining programming, electronics, and practical engineering to solve a real-world problem.
