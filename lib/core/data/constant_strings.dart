      My journey as a developer started in a university junior enterprise, where I led projects that connected technology with real business needs. As co-founder and President of Asimov Jr., I learned that great software is not just about code — it's about solving real problems, leading teams, and delivering value.
      Since 2020, I've developed production-ready apps using Flutter, working across industries like telecom and SaaS, and collaborating with product owners and agile teams. My skills extend to frontend frameworks like Vue.js, Angular, and React Native, plus backend support with .NET and Firebase.
      I also applied my engineering background to build a fuzzy logic-based control system for a lab-scale automation project during my Bachelor Thesis — an experience that sharpened my problem-solving mindset.
      Today, I'm focused on building scalable, high-quality products where clean code meets real-world impact. I'm continuously learning, growing, and ready for the next challenge.
